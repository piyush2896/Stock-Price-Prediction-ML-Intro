    "# Machine Learning Introduction By Example\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a game changer in today's world. We live in society where AI is making appointments for us, Cars are driving themselves, netflix knows what show we will love to bing watch and Amazon's recommendations know are needs before we know about them!\n",
    "\n",
    "To be aware of this society where we have AI eating up the industry we need to know what really goes inside this mystery box. Today we will be opening up the box and will try to expand our knowledge one post at a time.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning a set of techniques and algorithms that are applied to achieve a system that can improve with experience. There will be many formal definitions out there but this one gives a clear idea of what is the end goal!\n",
    "\n",
    "That said there are things that are learnt from a supervisor, there are things that need to learnt without any supervisor and yet there are things that are learnt from the reward of doing that thing! This brings us to the categories of Machine Learning:\n",
    "* Supervised Learning\n",
    "* Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "* Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "From the days we enter our schools till we pass it out we have a teacher as a supervisor that tells us what we have to do because he has an experience in that particular thing. We give him what we learnt and he tells us how wrong we are in our judgement and he continues to correct us. This leads us to a point that the judgement error we make is decreasing while our knowledge and experience in that field is increasing. This is what Supervised Learning is all about!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Supervised Learning we have a dataset that contains a pair of input and output. The task of the algorithm is to learn this mapping between input and output in such a manner that if it sees a new input that it hasn't seen before it should be able to guess the correct output. How does this happen? Any supervised learning algorithm follows this path:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Training:\n",
    " - Pass input to the algorithm and let it make a guess.\n",
    " - See the error between the output of the algorithm and true output\n",
    " - Adjust the parameters of algorithm to better next time\n",
    " - Repeat till stopping criteria is met (Either repeat it `n` times or until you get satisfactory accuracy of error.)\n",
    " ![](images/training.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Testing: This phase is similar to training expcept that we do not iterate over it. This phase, as name suggests, is to test the performance of our algorithm (aka model - from this point forward I'll use this name) over a dataset that it hasn't seen in training period. This gives us a general idea of how good the model is for real scenario!"

No one told you that its dangerous but you know it is. Will your brain react in similar way if a cat runs towards you. No right! Unsupervised Learning  is all about learning when there is no one to guide you what the input is all about. It brings about the hidden meaning in data.\n",

Yeah that's what we are going to talk about here! People who doesn't go for the bait of a small reward as they have realised from past big penalties and have reinforced their actions to meet the big reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is all about a machine deciding further actions that must be taken to maximize overall reward. The machine does this by taking into account past actions and what they led to. This means the more it work on same end goal the more experience it gets and the more rewarding its actions become.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general Reinforcement Learning takes in the state of the environment in which the machine/agent is and proposes an action. The action results in changing the state of the environment and generation of a reward. This reward is given to the RL and it decides the next action based on the reward it gets!\n",
